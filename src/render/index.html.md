What is Javascript ? 
> client side scripting
> wiki : An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers


- Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
- Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. 
  1. Communicate with a database
  2. Provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application
  3. Perform file manipulations on a server

Everything in javascript is an object. Aww!!!
> Act like objects.

Arrays, functions, even numbers! Because of this, you can do some really interesting things, such as modifying the prototypes of Objects, Arrays, etc.

- Written in `c++` ( v8 chrome `c++`, Spidermonkey firefox `c++` and Rhino `java` )
- primitive type ( `Boolean , Number , null , undefined and String` ( ex : `var letter = 'abc';` ) )
>Compared by value.

- non-primitive ( Object, Regex and Array )
>Compared by unique identity.
